## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload Multiple Images**  
   Drop in your photos (vacation, parties, events, etc.)

2. **Enter a Memory Prompt**  
   Type a theme like `"sunset at the beach"` or `"happy family moments"`

3. **Let the App Work**  
   - All images are converted into **CLIP embeddings**
   - Your text is also converted into an embedding
   - The app uses **FAISS** to find the **3 closest images** to your prompt
   - These images are stitched together into a **video slideshow**

4. **Watch Your Video**  
   A 15-second clip (5 seconds per image) is generated and shown in the app!
